<h1 class="underline">CSS BASICS</h1>
<p>CSS ( <span class="underline, bold">C</span>ascading <span class="underline, bold">S</span>tyle <span class="underline bold">S</span>heets) is the code that <span class="bold">styles</span> web content.
     CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. 
     We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? 
     How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? 
     How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
<h2 class="underline">What is CSS?</h2>
<p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either.
     CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.</p>

<p>The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset.</strong>
     (The term <em>ruleset</em> is often referred to as just <em>rule</em>.)
     <br>Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
     <ol>
         <li>
            <strong>Selector:</strong> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. 
                It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, 
                <a 
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"> < p >
                </a>
             elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
        
          </li>
          <br/>

          <li>
            <strong>Declaration:</strong>This is a single rule like color: red;.
                 It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
          </il>
          <br/>
          <br/>

          <li> <strong>Properties:</strong> These are ways in which you can style an HTML element.
             (In this example, color is a property of the 
             <a
             target="_blank" 
             href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"> < p > 
            </a> elements.) 
                    In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li>
            <strong>Properties Value:</strong> To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.
             (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.) 
         </li>
         
     </ol>
     <span id="note-important">
        <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
     </span>
    
     <ul>
         <li>Apart from the selector, 
             each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>

         <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) 
                 to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
          <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) 
              to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
     </ul>
